  <h1>Verification Methodology</h1>
  <p>Every knowledge unit on knowledgelib.io carries a confidence score, source provenance, and freshness indicator. This page explains how we assign and maintain these.</p>

  <h2>Confidence Score (0.0 - 1.0)</h2>
  <p>The confidence score reflects our assessment of how reliable and complete the knowledge unit is. It is NOT a probability that the content is correct — it's a composite measure of source quality, cross-verification, and completeness.</p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Score</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Requirements</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0.90 - 1.00</strong></td>
      <td>High confidence</td>
      <td>3+ independent sources, including at least 1 primary/authoritative source. All key claims cross-verified. No significant conflicting data found.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0.75 - 0.89</strong></td>
      <td>Good confidence</td>
      <td>2+ independent sources. Most claims cross-verified. Minor gaps or minor disagreements between sources noted in caveats.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0.60 - 0.74</strong></td>
      <td>Moderate confidence</td>
      <td>Sources available but limited cross-verification. Some claims rely on single sources. Domain may be rapidly changing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Below 0.60</strong></td>
      <td>Low confidence</td>
      <td>Unit is published as provisional. Limited sources or significant uncertainty. Clearly flagged for agents and users.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Source Reliability Ratings</h2>
  <p>Each source cited in a knowledge unit carries a reliability rating:</p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Rating</th><th>Definition</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>authoritative</strong></td>
      <td>Primary authority on the subject. Official, legally binding, or canonical.</td>
      <td>Government regulations (FERC orders), official standards (IEEE), manufacturer specs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>high</strong></td>
      <td>Rigorous methodology, peer review, or established editorial standards.</td>
      <td>LBNL research, RTINGS.com lab measurements, academic papers, Wirecutter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>moderate_high</strong></td>
      <td>Professional, generally reliable, but with potential biases or limited methodology transparency.</td>
      <td>Industry reports (ACP, IEA), established review sites (Tom's Guide, SoundGuys)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>moderate</strong></td>
      <td>Useful data but methodology unclear or potential commercial bias.</td>
      <td>Manufacturer white papers, sponsored reviews, industry press releases</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>low</strong></td>
      <td>Used only for context or when no better source exists. Clearly flagged.</td>
      <td>User forums, unverified community data, social media</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Freshness & Update Cycle</h2>
  <p>Each knowledge unit declares a <code>freshness</code> field indicating how often it's re-verified against primary sources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>monthly</strong> — rapidly changing domains (pricing, availability, market data)</li>
    <li><strong>quarterly</strong> — domains with regular update cycles (product launches, regulatory filings, industry reports)</li>
    <li><strong>yearly</strong> — stable domains (established regulations, fundamental frameworks, historical data)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <code>last_verified</code> date shows when the unit was last checked. If a unit's last_verified date exceeds its freshness cycle, it is flagged as potentially stale. We do not hide stale units — we mark them transparently.</p>

  <h2>Verification Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Source identification</strong> — identify all primary sources for the topic. Prefer government/institutional sources, peer-reviewed research, and established testing organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Claim extraction</strong> — extract specific, verifiable claims from each source. Every number, date, and factual statement must trace to a source.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-verification</strong> — check claims across multiple independent sources. Note disagreements in caveats.</li>
    <li><strong>Completeness check</strong> — ensure the unit answers the canonical question fully without requiring external sources. Check against common follow-up questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence scoring</strong> — assign confidence based on the criteria above.</li>
    <li><strong>Peer review</strong> — domain expert reviews the unit before publication.</li>
    <li><strong>Ongoing monitoring</strong> — track primary sources for updates. Re-verify on the declared freshness schedule.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't inflate confidence scores. A 0.75 means exactly what the table says.</li>
    <li>We don't hide uncertainty. Caveats and limitations are explicit in every unit.</li>
    <li>We don't publish units on topics where reliable sources don't exist. We'd rather have no unit than a bad one.</li>
    <li>We don't accept payment to influence content. Knowledge units are editorially independent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Version History</h2>
  <p>Every knowledge unit maintains a version number. Changes are tracked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Major version</strong> (1.0 → 2.0): Significant structural changes, new data sources, major corrections</li>
    <li><strong>Minor version</strong> (1.0 → 1.1): Price updates, freshness re-verification, minor corrections</li>
  </ul>
