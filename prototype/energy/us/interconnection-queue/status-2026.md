# US Interconnection Queue Status (2026)

## Summary

The US interconnection queue remains the primary bottleneck in energy transition deployment. As of end 2024, approximately **2,300 GW** of generation and storage capacity (~10,300 projects) sits in interconnection queues — down 12% from the prior year's ~2,600 GW peak, driven by historic withdrawal rates and fewer new requests. [src4] Despite this decline, the queue still far exceeds total installed US generation capacity. The median wait time from interconnection request to commercial operation has doubled from under 2 years (2000-2007) to over 4 years (2018-2024). [src4, src1]

A notable shift in 2024: natural gas capacity in the queue surged 72% year-over-year, while solar, storage, and wind capacity all declined. [src4] FERC Order 2023 reforms are now being implemented across ISOs, with cluster-based study processes replacing serial queues. [src2, src5]

## Key Facts

- Queue depth: ~2,300 GW total (1,400 GW generation + 890 GW storage), down 12% YoY [src4]
- Projects: ~10,300 actively seeking interconnection as of end 2024 [src4]
- Completion rate: Only ~13% of capacity entering the queue (2000-2019) reached commercial operation [src4]
- Withdrawal rate: 77% of historical queue capacity was withdrawn [src4]
- Median timeline: Over 4 years from request to operation; was under 2 years for projects built 2000-2007 [src4]
- Agreements pending: 408 GW has draft or executed interconnection agreements but has not yet reached commercial operations [src4]
- Proposed COD: 49% of total queue capacity (1,271 GW) targets commercial operation by end 2026 [src4]
- Technology mix (end 2024): Solar 956 GW (-12% YoY), Storage 890 GW (-13% YoY), Wind 271 GW (-26% YoY), Natural gas 136 GW (+72% YoY) [src4]
- Cost: Interconnection study costs alone range $50K-$2M+ depending on size and complexity [src3]

## Regulatory Context

FERC Order 2023 (issued July 2023, effective 2024) introduced cluster-based study processes, financial readiness requirements, and defined deadlines to reduce speculative applications and speed up interconnection studies. [src2] FERC Order 2023-A (issued March 2024) made minor clarifications but preserved the core reform framework. [src5]

**Regional implementation progress (2025):**
- PJM completed Transition Cycle 1 (September 2025): 130 requests representing ~17.4 GW (56% solar, 25% wind, 10% storage, 5% hybrid, 3% gas). Transition Cycle 2 (~46 GW) expected to complete by end of 2026. [src7]
- SPP cleared its entire legacy backlog dating back to 2018 by September 2025, transitioning to its Consolidated Planning Process. [src4]
- ISO New England's compliance was accepted by FERC in April 2025, with transitional cluster studies beginning late 2025. [src5]

**Data center / large load demand (new pressure):**
- DOE issued a Section 403 directive (October 2025) requiring FERC to establish rulemaking for large load interconnections (>20 MW), with a final rule deadline of April 30, 2026. [src6]
- ERCOT alone reported 226 GW of large load customers (77% data centers) in its queue as of November 2025 — a 258% increase from 63 GW at end of 2024. [src6]

## Causal Factors

1. Speculative applications: Low barriers to entry led to queue flooding — 77% of historical capacity was eventually withdrawn [src4, src2]
2. Transmission capacity: Insufficient grid buildout to absorb new generation [src3]
3. Study process: Serial study approach created cascading delays when projects withdrew [src2]
4. Workforce: Insufficient engineering staff at utilities and ISOs to process studies [src3]
5. Interconnection cost uncertainty: Study cost escalation deters smaller developers [src3]
6. Data center demand: Surging AI/data center power needs adding massive new load interconnection requests — ERCOT's large load queue grew 258% in one year [src6]

## Decision Logic

### If stakeholder is a solar or wind developer
→ Expect 4+ year timelines from application to operation. Budget for interconnection study costs of $50K-$2M+ and be prepared for potential cost escalation during the study process. Focus on areas with available transmission capacity. [src4, src3]

### If stakeholder is a storage developer
→ Storage represents ~890 GW in queue (39% of total capacity). Co-location with generation projects may provide faster interconnection paths. [src4]

### If stakeholder is evaluating natural gas projects
→ Natural gas queue capacity surged 72% YoY in 2024, reflecting growing data center and AI power demand. Competition for gas interconnection slots is increasing. [src4]

### If planning horizon is near-term (1-2 years)
→ Only projects with executed interconnection agreements (408 GW pool) are likely to reach operation. New applications filed today face 4+ year timelines. [src4]

### If planning horizon is long-term (5+ years)
→ FERC Order 2023 cluster reforms should reduce speculative applications and improve study processing times by 2027+. Transmission buildout remains the binding long-term constraint. [src2, src5, src3]

### If stakeholder is a data center developer
→ New FERC rulemaking on large load interconnection (>20 MW) is expected by April 2026. ERCOT's large load queue surged to 226 GW. Consider co-location with existing generation or "bring your own generation" programs (PJM). [src6, src7]

### If evaluating investment in queued projects
→ Only 13% of historical queue capacity reached operation; 77% was withdrawn. Prioritize projects that already have interconnection agreements — 408 GW of capacity is in this "near-ready" pool. [src4]

## Trend Direction

Mixed but cautiously improving. The 12% YoY decline in queue volume is a positive signal, though driven partly by withdrawals rather than completions. [src4]

Expect:
- FERC Order 2023 cluster reforms to reduce new speculative applications (2025-2026) — early results are positive (PJM Cycle 1 complete, SPP backlog cleared) [src2, src5, src7]
- Legacy backlog remains severe through ~2027 [src3]
- Natural gas and data center load interconnection demand surging — ERCOT large load queue grew 258% in one year [src4, src6]
- New FERC rulemaking on large load interconnection expected by April 2026 [src6]
- Transmission buildout is the binding constraint long-term [src3]

## Important Caveats

- Queue capacity ≠ built capacity: Most proposed projects will never be built (77% historical withdrawal rate) [src4]
- Regional variation: Queue conditions vary dramatically by ISO/RTO — national averages mask local extremes [src1]
- Study cost data is approximate and varies widely by project size, location, and grid conditions [src3]
- FERC Order 2023 implementation is ongoing; full impact on processing times will not be measurable until ~2027
