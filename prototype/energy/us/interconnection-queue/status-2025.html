# US Interconnection Queue Status (2025)

## Summary

The US interconnection queue remains the primary bottleneck in energy transition deployment. As of early 2025, approximately 2,600 GW of generation and storage capacity sits in interconnection queues — roughly double the entire installed US generation fleet. Average wait times are 4-5 years from application to commercial operation. [src1, src3]

## Key Facts

- Queue depth: ~2,600 GW total capacity waiting (up from ~2,000 GW in 2023) [src1]
- Completion rate: Only ~14% of projects entering the queue since 2000 have reached commercial operation [src1]
- Average timeline: 4-5 years from request to operation; was ~3 years a decade ago [src1, src3]
- Dominant technology: Solar (65%) and storage (25%) dominate new queue entries [src1]
- Cost: Interconnection study costs alone range $50K-$2M+ depending on size and complexity [src3]

## Regulatory Context

FERC Order 2023 (effective 2024) introduced cluster-based study processes and financial readiness requirements to reduce speculative applications. Early signs suggest new application volumes may moderate, but the existing backlog will take years to clear. [src2]

## Causal Factors

1. Speculative applications: Low barriers to entry led to queue flooding [src2]
2. Transmission capacity: Insufficient grid buildout to absorb new generation [src3]
3. Study process: Serial study approach created cascading delays when projects withdrew [src2]
4. Workforce: Insufficient engineering staff at utilities and ISOs to process studies [src3]

## Trend Direction

Mixed. Reform is underway but structural backlog persists. Expect:
- Modest improvement in new application processing (2025-2026)
- Legacy backlog remains severe through ~2027
- Transmission buildout is the binding constraint long-term
